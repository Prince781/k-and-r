<span style="color: #789922;">&gt;implying anyone will find this useful</span>

My solutions to all eight chapters of _The C Programming Language, Second
 Edition_. Note that a couple of Chapter 1 exercises may be missing.

Also note that I attempted to only use concepts from each chapter, hence the
use of `char[]` in function arguments for the first few chapters before
pointers are introduced, for example.

Use this however you'd like, and let me know about any incorrect/misleading
approaches in these solutions.
